# Infectio

Agent-based modeling for Virological Plaque.

![sample of simulation visualization](./attachments/sample_simulation.gif)

The image above shows the output of a simulation run. (top-left) shows spatial
positions of infected (green) and susceptible (blue) cells, (top-right) shows
concentrations of particles and molecules produced by the system in the same
spatial space as top-left, and (three bottom rows) show metrics produced by the
experiment, which are the radius of the plaque, average radial velocity, and
susceptible and infected population sizes, from top to bottom. These metrics,
possibly with others, are used to evaluate simulation with a reference which is
obtained from real world plaque experiements.

# How to use

## Install dependecies

### Conda
`conda create env -f environment.yml`.

### venv
Could not make conda nor poetry work on hemera, using venv instead: 
```shell
python -m venv ./venv;
source ./venv/bin/activate;
pip install -r requirements.txt;
```

## Run simulation

### VACV + Epithelial model

Create a config file (e.g. similiar to [default config](./infectio/models/vacv/default_config.ini)) and modify
accordingly. You can also use arguments in CLI instead (take a look at `--help` for available options). Then with
python environment active, run: `python(3) infectio/models/vacv/run.py -c path/to/config.py [optional arguments]`.

## Create a new model
TBD

# Notes

* CHANGELOG 20.06.2023: change the three phenotype metrics to area, number, and radial velocity.
I think radius is not very well defined, whether it is from infection center or
from convex center, and which one, the average, min, max, etc. So better to use
area which shows the territory of the plaque/virus.

* Inconsistency for Radius information; in std output, the radius to center of 
infection is shown. In graph plots, the center to convex center is shown.

* Default num_cells = 2750 number used in configs are based on the density of
cells computed on a single image with pixel dimensions that could possibly be 
wrong. So be cautious about its correctness. The calculations you can find at 
MacBookM1->workspace/Cellpose/01_analyze_results.ipynb

* vmin and vmax of colorbar are based on 5 and 95 % of the data. If vmax is max, then the rest of the plot except for a few locations is almost in the very low range of colorbar range and not very clear. Needs better clarification, but most probably because molecule diffusion very very slow in the medium and the single point peak stays large during the diffusion for few steps.

* Assumption in code: x,y coords start from lower left. particle variable u also same, i.e. rows correspond with x and
columns with y, first row is x=0 and first column is y=0. Therefore for ploting u, need to do
plt.imshow(u.T, origin='lower')

* cells are points. So molecules are produced at a single location. They also do not collide, ...

* Can we avoid discretization of particle scalar fields and work completely with
well defined function. For example solve the diffusion with it, and also for
gradient computations be able to use [this python package: numdifftools](https://numdifftools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

* More accurate gradients? Look here [Structure tensor and diagonal gradients](https://bartwronski.com/2021/02/28/computing-gradients-on-grids-forward-central-and-diagonal-differences/)
